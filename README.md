# Airbnb Seattle dataset investigation

In this project I picked the Airbnb seattle dataset, and investigate the date to find answers for the following questions:

- When is the rush time for booking homestays at seattle?
- For homestays unlike hotels, I care a lot about the host, so how to choose a host?
- Does the host good communication and response means he is better than others?
